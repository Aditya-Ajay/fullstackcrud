SO HOW TO MAKE A CRUD APPLICATION 



==> THE TWO FOLDER  IS CREATED 


1- backend 


2- frontend 



IN THE BACKEND WE WILL FOLLOW THE MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER PATTERN

SO FIRST OF ALL WE CREATED THE MODEL 

=====> WHICH REPRESENTS THE DATABASE OF OUR PROJECT 

=====>  A schema is a JSON object that defines the the structure and contents of your data.

======================>>>>>> SO NOW THE MODEL IS CREATED 


============================================================


AFTER THE CREATION OF MODEL , ROUTES NEEDS TO BE DEFINED 

AFTER ROUTES , CONTROLLER IS NEEDED WHICH WILL TELL , HOW TO MODIFFY THE DATBASE 



ROUTES WILL ALSO DEFINE GET , POST, PATCH , DELETE METHODS



NOW WE WILL ALSO  START THE SERVER AND USE DIFFERENET MIDDLEWARE




===> THEN WE NEED TO TEST THE DIIFERENT ENDPOINTS OF OUR API USING POSTMAN 



================================================================================================





NOW THE ROLE OF FRONTEND COMES IN PLAY , WITH WHOM USER WILL INTERACT 


NOW FIRST WE WILL CREATE A BASIC FORM AND BELOW IT WE WILL DISPLAY ALL THE USERS WITH EDIT DELETE AND WITH SPECIFIC USER FUNCTIONALITY

AND THEN WE WILL CREATE SLICE 


AND THEN WE WILL FETCH THE ROUTES ACCORDING TO THE DIFFRENT FUNCTIONALITY
